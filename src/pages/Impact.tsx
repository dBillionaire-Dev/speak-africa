              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In Lagos, our Environmental Storytelling Club mobilized over 200 community members to participate in a major clean-up operation, removing 2 tons of plastic waste from local waterways.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The club members used their storytelling skills to create compelling narratives about the importance of clean water, which were shared through community radio and social media.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                As a result, the local government committed to implementing a regular waste collection schedule and installing waste bins throughout the community.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Participants in our Voices for Her program identified a gap in girls' access to education in their community and launched a "Back to School" campaign.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The campaign included storytelling events, community dialogues, and meetings with local leaders, highlighting the barriers to girls' education and proposing solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Their efforts resulted in a local scholarship fund that has supported 25 girls to return to school and complete their education.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Youth advocates from our 7 Days of Environmental Action campaign presented compelling stories and data to the city council about the impact of plastic pollution.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Their presentations, backed by community support mobilized through storytelling, led to the adoption of a new policy limiting single-use plastics in the city.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                This policy is estimated to reduce plastic waste by 30% annually, demonstrating the power of youth advocacy in creating systemic change.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Through our leadership and public speaking training, a group of 15 young people from underserved communities developed the confidence and skills to advocate for their needs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                These youth have gone on to lead community projects, speak at national conferences, and mentor other young people in their communities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Five of them have been appointed to local youth councils, where they now influence policy decisions affecting young people.
